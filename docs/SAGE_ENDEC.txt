          Automating Required Weekly Tests on a Sage Digital ENDEC

Rivendell can be configured to allow Required Weekly Tests (RWTs) for the
Emergency Alert System (EAS) to be executed directly from a macro cart,
using the Digital ENDEC Emergency Alert (EAS) Unit Manufactured by Sage
Systems.

PROCEDURES
Create a macro cart and populate it with the following RML:

   RN sage_endec_rwt.sh <ip-addr> <web-user> <web-password>!

where:

     <ip-addr> - The IP address of the ENDEC system..
    <web-user> - The name used to log in to the ENDEC's web interface.
<web-password> - The password used to log into the ENDEC's web interface.

For example, for an ENDEC at 192.168.0.1 with a login name of 'admin'
and a login password of 'letmein', you'd use:

    RN sage_endec_rwt.sh 192.168.0.1 admin letmein!

Whenever this macro cart is executed, the ENDEC will run an RWT.
