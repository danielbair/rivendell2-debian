                    RDMonitor / RDSelect Configuration

The Rivendell RDMonitor module can be used to monitor the health state
(Database + Audio Store) of a system.  Optionally, it can also be used
with RDSelect to allow a host to be switched between multiple Database +
AudioStore setups.  This document describes the procedure for converting
an existing Rivendell setup to allow this functionality.

1) OVERVIEW
Rivendell requires that a configuration file exist at '/etc/rd.conf'
that describes basic parameters (such as login information for the MySQL
database server).  RDMonitor/RDSelect build on this foundation by
utilizing a set of one or more configuration files located in the
'/etc/rivendell/' directory, with the 'current' configuration indicated
by a symbolic link at '/etc/rd.conf' that points to the desired configuration
in '/etc/rivendell.d/'.  Several new parameters have been added to
rd.conf(5) to support this mode of operation, including:

[Identity]
Label=<label>

[AudioStore]
MountSource=<mnt-src>
MountType=<mnt-type>
MountOptions=<mnt-opts>

Where:
<label> - A text string that is displayed to indicate the overall name
of this configuration.

<mnt-src> - The filesystem to be mounted at '/var/snd' when using this
configuration, such as would be provided in fstab(5).  If the desired
audio store resides on the root filesystem, then this field should be
left blank.

<mnt-type> - The type of audio store mount, such as would be specified in
fstab(5).

<mnt-opts> - The mount point options for the audio store, such as would
be specified in fstab(5).


2) CONVERTING AN OLD-STYLE SETUP
An 'old-style' setup --i.e. one that consists of a single configuration
file at '/etc/rd.conf'-- can be converted to the new layout through the
following steps:

A) Create the configuration directory:

   mkdir -p /etc/rivendell.d

B) Move the original configuration file:

   mv /etc/rd.conf /etc/rivendell.d/rd-default.conf

C) Create the symbolic link:

   ln -s /etc/rivendell.d/rd-default.conf /etc/rd.conf
